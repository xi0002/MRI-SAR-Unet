# Deep Learning-Based Prediction of Specific Absorption Rate Induced by Ultra-High-Field MRI RF Head Coil

This repository provides an implementation of [a deep learning-based method for predicting SAR distributions in human head models](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10955187), developed using Python 3, Keras, and TensorFlow. The model leverages U-Net and its variants to predict 3D SAR distributions from head tissue properties—specifically conductivity and permittivity—and the incident E-field.
